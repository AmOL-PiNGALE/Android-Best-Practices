## The coding principles

#### SOLID

It's a mnemonic acronym that helps define the five basic object-oriented design principles:

* Single Responsibility Principle
* Open-Closed Principle
* Liskov Substitution Principle
* Interface Segregation Principle
* Dependency Inversion Principle

#### Don’t repeat yourself (DRY) principle

- Never ever write same piece of code twice make it your ironclad rule and strictly prohibit this in your kingdom.

#### Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)

- It means you should be writing code as simple as possible. Don't get caught up in trying to be overly clever or showing off with a paragraph of advanced code. If you can write a script in one line, write it in one line.
- Use clear variable names. Take advantage of coding libraries to use existing tools. Make it easy to come back after six months and get right back to work. Keeping it simple will save you the headache.

#### The Boy Scout Rule

> Definition: Leave the campground cleaner than you found it

- From clean code by uncle bob, I like this rule so when i work on a bad code i refactor, clean, reduce and make it more meaningful and readable than before. Always keep your surrounding’s clean because president is too busy building a wall.

#### The Critics principle

- Okay it's totally made up but it's very logical. When you're reviewing code of your teammates don't be a friend, Be their arch enemy, don't let them make mistakes that you might have to clean someday. Cleaning other's shit will make your hand dirty. Enforce good practices in code reviews.

#### You Aren't Going to Need It (YAGNI)

- This principle means you should never code for functionality on the chance that you may need in the future. Don't try and solve a problem that doesn't exist.
- In an effort to write DRY code, programmers can violate this principle. Often inexperienced programmers try to write the most abstract and generic code they can. Too much abstraction causes bloated code that is impossible to maintain.
- Only apply the DRY principle only when you need to. If you notice chunks of code written over and over, then abstract them. Don't think too far out at the expense of your current code batch.
