## The coding principles

#### SOLID

It's a mnemonic acronym that helps define the five basic object-oriented design principles:

* Single Responsibility Principle
* Open-Closed Principle
* Liskov Substitution Principle
* Interface Segregation Principle
* Dependency Inversion Principle

#### Don’t repeat yourself (DRY) principle

Never ever write same piece of code twice make it your ironclad rule and strictly prohibit this in your kingdom.

#### The Boy Scout Rule

> Definition: Leave the campground cleaner than you found it

From clean code by uncle bob, I like this rule so when i work on a bad code i refactor, clean, reduce and make it more meaningful and readable than before. Always keep your surrounding’s clean because president is too busy building a wall.

#### The Critics principle

Okay it's totally made up but it's very logical. When you're reviewing code of your teammates don't be a friend, Be their arch enemy, don't let them make mistakes that you might have to clean someday. Cleaning other's shit will make your hand dirty. Enforce good practices in code reviews.
